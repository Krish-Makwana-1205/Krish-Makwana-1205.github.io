<h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
<img src="fractional.jpg" alt=" ">
<p>
  Math is used all around us from the most obvious to the most peculiar
things. This pushes us to think about what can be achieved by implementing
maths. This is our attempt at gauging opportunities and problems that
can be solved with the help of maths. The field of maths we chose for our
project is fractional calculus. This maths topic is growing widely in many
different applications in physics, Economics, Finance, and many more. It
generalizes the operations performed using differentiation and integration to
non-integer. Non-integer orders are often used in fractional calculus which
are real numbers that is not an integer. We must have learned in high
school about differentiation and integration where we try to find out the
derivative or integration of some function by applying basic differentiation
and integration properties. We know that the first derivative of the function
indicates the slope and the second derivative indicates concavity. But, have
you ever wondered if we can also find the half derivative or half integral of
any function?
</p>

<h2>1.2 History</h2>
<p>
The topic of our project is Fractional Calculus. It is more than 300 years old.
Fractional derivative first appeared in a letter written by <mark>Gottfried Wihelm
Leibniz</mark> to<mark>Guillaume de L’Hopital</mark> where the meaning of half-derivative has
been raised. <mark>30th September 1965</mark>, was the date when fractional calculus was
born. In the 19th century, the theory of fractional calculus was the great fact
of interest among the great minds which included Euler, Laplace, Fourier,
Lacroix, Abel, Reimann, and Lioville. In 1819, Lacroix in one of his books,
he gave the correct answer to the question which Leibniz mentioned in his
letter where he found the correct answer of half-derivative of x is 2\( \sqrt{\frac{x}{\pi}} \)
During the 19th Century, fractional calculus had further improvement with
Riemann introducing many more definitions of fractional derivatives and integrals.
An English physicist Oliver Heaviside also made many contributions
to some practical applications of fractional calculus. During the 20th century,
it became a tool that can be used for modeling complex phenomena in
various fields.

    <h2>1.3 Current Affairs</h2>
    <p>
      As we all know maths continues with every passing day. In recent times
with the advent of new technology fractional calculus has found its place in
implementation.</p>
<p>• visco-elastic diffusion in complex liquids(Langevin fractional equation)</p>
<p>• Ubiquitous fractional order memory system</p>
<p>• Image Processing</p>
<p>• Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)</p>
<p>• Machine Learning</p>
<p>• Tautochrone Curve Further down the document we are going further</p>
<p>focus on the Tautochrone curve and its applications. Fractional calculus
will possibly see a rise in its learners because of its vast applications
especially those in machine learning would attract significant interest
in the subject.
    </p>
    <h2>Fractional Differentiation</h2>
    <p>In high school, we studied differentiation where we used to find the derivative
      of continuous functions. What we used to do was to plot the curve of the
      slope of that function at every single point. Now, let’s consider finding a
      half derivative of a function like:- $$x^3$$, sinx, etc... Such type of differentiation
      is called fractional differentiation.</p>

    <h2>CAUCHY’S FORMULA FOR REPEATED INTEGRATION</h2> 
    <p>$$n \int_ f($$a^t$$) \, dx^n = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \int_{a}^{t} (t - x)^{n-1} f(x) \, dx$$</p>

          <h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
          <img src="C:\Users\SHOBHIT CHANDRA\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots" alt=" ">
          <p>
            Math is used all around us from the most obvious to the most peculiar
  things. This pushes us to think about what can be achieved by implementing
  maths. This is our attempt at gauging opportunities and problems that
  can be solved with the help of maths. The field of maths we chose for our
  project is fractional calculus. This maths topic is growing widely in many
  different applications in physics, Economics, Finance, and many more. It
  generalizes the operations performed using differentiation and integration to
  non-integer. Non-integer orders are often used in fractional calculus which
  are real numbers that is not an integer. We must have learned in high
  school about differentiation and integration where we try to find out the
  derivative or integration of some function by applying basic differentiation
  and integration properties. We know that the first derivative of the function
  indicates the slope and the second derivative indicates concavity. But, have
  you ever wondered if we can also find the half derivative or half integral of
  any function?
  </p>
      
        <h2>1.2 History</h2>
        <p>
          The topic of our project is Fractional Calculus. It is more than 300 years old.
  Fractional derivative first appeared in a letter written by <mark>Gottfried Wihelm
  Leibniz</mark> to<mark>Guillaume de L’Hopital</mark> where the meaning of half-derivative has
  been raised. <mark>30th September 1965</mark>, was the date when fractional calculus was
  born. In the 19th century, the theory of fractional calculus was the great fact
  of interest among the great minds which included Euler, Laplace, Fourier,
  Lacroix, Abel, Reimann, and Lioville. In 1819, Lacroix in one of his books,
  he gave the correct answer to the question which Leibniz mentioned in his
  letter where he found the correct answer of half-derivative of x is 2\( \sqrt{\frac{x}{\pi}} \)
  During the 19th Century, fractional calculus had further improvement with
  Riemann introducing many more definitions of fractional derivatives and integrals.
  An English physicist Oliver Heaviside also made many contributions
  to some practical applications of fractional calculus. During the 20th century,
  it became a tool that can be used for modeling complex phenomena in
  various fields.
        </p>
        <h2>1.3 Current Affairs</h2>
        <p>
          As we all know maths continues with every passing day. In recent times
  with the advent of new technology fractional calculus has found its place in
  implementation.</p>
  <p>• visco-elastic diffusion in complex liquids(Langevin fractional equation)</p>
  <p>• Ubiquitous fractional order memory system</p>
  <p>• Image Processing</p>
  <p>• Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)</p>
  <p>• Machine Learning</p>
  <p>• Tautochrone Curve Further down the document we are going further</p>
  <p>focus on the Tautochrone curve and its applications. Fractional calculus
  will possibly see a rise in its learners because of its vast applications
  especially those in machine learning would attract significant interest
  in the subject.
        </p>
        <h3>Memory storage</h3>
        <p>Fractional derivatives are derived from integrals. This means that the value
  of fractional derivative at a point depends on the previous points as well.
  This could be thought as some kind of memory. And thus fractional calculus
  can be applied for storing memory effectively. We can also use fractional
  calculus to model things with memory such as genetics.
  </p>
  <h3>Fractional derivative correlation with anomalous diffusion and fluid dynamics</h3>
  <p>Fractional calculus enables us to study fluid dynamics more accurately. The
  use of fractional calculus is to derive various fluid dynamics equations. Particularly
  when studying anomalous diffusion where the commonly used equation
  given by Adolf Fick for diffusion does not work.The equation by Adolf Fick
  is</p>
  <p><img src="img1.jpg" alt=" "></p>
  <p>Using fractional calculus we can make the equation available for anomalous
  diffusions by tweaking the formula</p> 
  <p><img src="img2.jpg" alt=" "></p>
  <p>fluid flow can be highly chaotic. The need of fractional calculus arises in order
      to encapsulate these movements in form of equations and to study them.
      Sub-diffusion and super-diffusion are to of the anomalies whose results could
      be calculated using the equation which utilizes fractional calculus.
      Apart from diffusion in liquid fractional calculus can be used to more accurately
      predict anomalous diffusion of heat, finance, plasma infusion reactors,
      flow of underground water.</p>
      <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>
          <img src="C:\Users\SHOBHIT CHANDRA\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots" alt=" ">
          In a 2018 speech by Mamikon Gulian he talked how machine learning
          could be used to derive complex equations using fractional calculus. Fractional
          calculus could be used to derive equations for multiple problems butthe obstacle is that it takes a lot of time to calculate complex fractional
          calculus equations. He mentioned of Michael Schmidth and Hod Lipson
          discovered the conservation Law of a double pendulum back in 2009 using
          machine learning. This makes the learning of fractional calculus that much
          more motivating. The conclusion of the speech was that a hidden branch of
          physics could be discovered by employing the strength of machine learning.
          One of the most attractive use of fractional order differential equation is to
          be able to model natural phenomena in the form of equations.</p>
          <p>On the other hand fractional calculus helps develop machine learning by aiding
              in creating complex algorithms. So it would be fair to say that there is
              some kind of symbiotic relationship between machine learning and fractional
              calculus.</p>
              <p>As we know machine learning requires studying a lot of data and patterns
                  these patterns can be modeled with the help of fractional derivative. These
                  patterns might have been needed to approximate if we had integral order
                  differential equations only.One profound use of the combination of machine
                  learning and fractional calculus could be to detect fractional behaviour out of
                  data. When we feed data to a machine it would be able to tell what function
                  of fractional derivative is working. We can use this functionality to predict
                  the future by simply deriving an equation for it. This could potentially be
                  of use in the stock market.</p>
              <p>Fractional calculus could aid machine learning in various ways such as processing
                      the data before it has been fed for to the machine for training. This
                      process is known as pre-processing. For example in spectroscopy the data is
                      first refined by fractional calculus algorithms so that when we apply machine
                      learning it could produce more accurate results.

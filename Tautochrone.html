        <h1>TAUTOCHRONE CURVE</h1>
    </header>

        <h2>2.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>The tautochrone curve, the strange and interesting curve has so many implementations
in real-world problems (some of which are also mentioned in
the Application part of this article ) and that’s why this intriguing curve has
gained the interest of many brilliant scientists over the last few centuries.
The tautochrone curve is a visible form of the idea of a unique geometrical
path on which one sliding object is moving the time taken by the object to
reach the lowest part of the curve depends on the gravitational pull experienced
by the object and not the initial condition of the object from which
the object started moving. The tautochrone curve is also the shortest Path
taken by any sliding body on a smooth surface and under uniform gravitational
pull. This curve is also known as isochrone (as in Greek tauto- has
the same meaning as iso.). the tautochrone curve was a part of the cycloid
(Cycloid curve traced by the point on the rim of the rolling wheel ).
As we mentioned earlier the time taken by a sliding object to reach the
lowest part of the tautochrone curve which is also known as time of descent
(Denoted by T) can be expressed from the curve geometry and gravitational
acceleration (Denoted by g). For a frictionless tautochrone curve, the mathematical
expression for the time of descent is given by:-</p>

<p>T = π\( \sqrt{\frac{a}{g}} \)</p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p>1. a is the parameteric constant of cycloid.</p>
<p>2. g is the acceleration due to gravity.</p>
<p>3. T is the time of descent</p>
<p>From the formula, one could easily say that the time of descent is solely
a function of height from the starting point to the lowest point And the
gravitational acceleration. Irrespective of the initial condition of the object’s
motion.It is to be noted that if a particle is moving to the lowest point of
curve then we can write π otherwise we have to write angle that we will use
in parameteric co-ordinates of cycloid instead of π.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
The first attempt to find the tautochrone curve was made by Christiaan
Huygens in,1659. Huygen first mentioned this curve in his work Horologium
Oscillatorium, this is considered as one of the three greatest works on Mechanics
in the 17th century. Which was published in 1659. The motivation
for Huygens to research more on the tautochrone problem is because he realizes
that the pendulum follows the isochrone(which is also known as the
tautochrone path). After determining the curve, he attempts to create a
pendulum clock by using a string and the bob and a curb check near the
top of the string. but his attempt fails because of the friction caused by
the bending of the string and many more. In his paper on generalization
on tautochrone he mentioned the framework of fractional order calculus and
in this paper, he also mentioned the complete notation of the fractional integration
and differentiation. N.H. Abel in this work mentioned fractional
integration in a form that is currently known as Riemann -Liouville integration
and fractional differentiation in the form that is currently known as
Caputo derivative. N.H. Abel during this problem research also proved that
fractional integration and fractional differentiation are mutually inverse. After
144 years Michele Caputo came up with his work in 1967. As Abel’s
discovery remained unnoticed even by himself Caputo’s name is associated
with fractional derivative definition.

<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>The tautochrone curve has great importance in past, present, and even in the
future it is going to develop more some of its past and current applications
are mentioned in this section of our report and these are as follows:-</p>
<p>1 . The Tautochrone curve is utilized for maintaining a constant period of
oscillation in a pendulum clock which makes the clock very accurate.</p>
<p>2 . The Tautochrone curve is used to design roller coaster tracks such that
during vertical drop roller coaster can achieve its maximum speed.</p>
<p>3 . Downhill skiers generally choose the path that is close to the tautochrone
curve to reach fastest to the endpoint.</p>
<p>4 . Tautochrone curve is used to study material behavior under the influence
of gravity so one can study the dynamic of the material .</p>
<p>5 . The Tautochrone curve is used in analyzing the orbits of celestial bodies
under gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Even one can notice the Tautochrone curve in nature sometimes in streams,
water flow also forms the Tautochrone curve.</p>
